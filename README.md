# LAB - 11 / 12 / 13

## Project: CAPS

### Authors: Ike Steoger

### Problem Domain

Application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased. First built with EventEmitters and then transfered to Socket.io functionality. Also added functionality to queue events & emit them when connection is made.
